1. What design choices did you make (colors, fonts, layout)?
I used grey or near white accents background (#FDFDFD) for a clean and modern look.  
Text is center-aligned for balance, and the layout follows the CRAP model (Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, Proximity).  

2. How did you ensure the screen is user-friendly and accessible?
Text sizes use `sp` units for readability, and elements are evenly spaced using `ConstraintLayout` for responsive design. 
The color contrast ensures visibility even in different lighting.  

3. What would you improve if this were a real app?  
Iâ€™d add functionality for editing the profile, uploading photos, and maybe adding social media links or dark mode.
